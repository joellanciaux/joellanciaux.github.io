This is, more or less, an initial post so that my blog isn't
completely empty when I pushed it up.

I'll be expanding on some of these in later days, but here's a small set of what I've been playing around with lately.

- [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/)
  - Check out my brother's _excellent_ React-only-powered grid component, [Griddle](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle/).
I've been able to toss in a few push requests, so that's been fun.
- Atom, which has gotten _considerably_ better since the initial release.
  - And what's this? [Atom is going to be moving some of its render to React?](http://blog.atom.io/2014/07/02/moving-atom-to-react.html)
- Angular + Cordova

Excitement!
